When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here
    To share with other developer that work on the same project with me. To have a backup. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Fill in your answer here
    You may be working on functions/ adding new features that are not ready to conbine with other people's code yet. Git automatically stary up-to-date might cause confusions and conflict. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fill in your answer here
    Forks is for copying a repository from GitHub directly onto GitHub, clone is for copying a repository from GitHub to local or from local to another place local. Branches are for within the same repository but different branches. A branch copies all the previous commit from the branch the you were working on when you branch out. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    So that when you collaborate with others, you won't be running into conflicts all the time. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Fill in your answer here
    Seperate the work into different function/feature, write the code seperately, exchange files and compare difference, resolve conflict by checking the code line by line. Git is much easier to find out what causes conflict and exchanging files, as well as avoiding bugs introduced by merging files, and even when bugs are introduced, it is easier to get back to the previous bug-free version.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
